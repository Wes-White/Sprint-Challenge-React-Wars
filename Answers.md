1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React solves the problem of DOM updates. So if a lot of information is changing in the DOM the information can be updated quickly and easily. React does this by creating a virtual DOM and only looks for changes within that virtual DOM. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I think this means to think of things as components or resuable. I am still trying to figure this out. 

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional coponents do not have any state, I think this would be the main difference. While Class components will have state and methods. 

4.  Describe state.

State keeps track of information about data, it is basically just data storage. State can be passed down to child components using props. This allows us to take data from one coponent and use it in another. 

5.  Describe props.

Props are little pieces of data or properties that can be passed on to other components.
